          <p>Palm OS was a mobile operating system for personal digital assistants (PDAs) that was initially developed
            by Palm, Inc.
            <br>It was designed for ease of use with a touchscreen-based graphical user interface (GUI) and was known
            for its reliability and efficiency.
            <br>Palm OS was also one of the first operating systems to include a built-in application programming
            interface (API), which made it easy for developers to create third-party applications for Palm devices.
